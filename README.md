# Overview

This project contains the [Hugo][hugo] _("one of the most popular open-source static site generators")_ resources for my
personal website, [thoughtspark.org](http://www.thoughtspark.org).  This site uses a modified version
_(modifications trackable in commit history)_ the [Anatole](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/anatole/) theme.
