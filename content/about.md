My name is Jeremy Whitlock and I struggle with describing myself.  First and foremost, I am a Christian man and a father
to two incredible boys.  The way I provide for my kids is I am fortunate enough to work at Google, working on various
parts of [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/gcp).  I also have spent a great deal of time working on open source
projects for well over 20 years, including earning a position on the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) Technical
Steering Committee.  I am a powerlifter, a Jeep owner and I am just trying to live the eff out of this life before I end
up six foot under.

One of the things I've taken up over the last few years is I really love doing
[sports photography](https://jeremywhitlock.smugmug.com/).  When I was younger, the only time I saw myself playing
sports was if I was lucky enough to be in the newspaper or in the yearbook at the end of the year.  So when my boys
started playing sports for their school, I started taking photos at the games and uploading them for the
families/players to use free of charge.  To say I'm a photographer is probably a stretch but I really do enjoy
photography, especially sports photography.

I will do my best to keep this page up to date as I think of things.  Honestly, this page is here just to avoid a `404`.
