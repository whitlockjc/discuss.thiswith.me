I've hosted a few blogs over the years, and all of them met the same demise.  What started out as a grand plan to share
useful articles ended up being a few posts here and there, and finally a cease to all writing in general.  I feel like I
love to write, but I didn't seem to care for it after a bit and I was perplexed.  Thankfully, the last few years I've
spent a lot of time focusing on myself and growing which opened my eyes to the truth: I was burnt out.

I think the burnout was primarily due to me burning the candle at both ends, trying so hard to be valuable that I worked
my full-time job and surrounded that time with extra time at the laptop working on other projects.  While there is
nothing wrong with this, I definitely was feeling the adverse effects of contributing for the wrong reasons.  And I was
also siloing my contributions to only software-related ventures, which made it difficult because my day job and my
_"fun"_ stuff was hard to separate.  Long story short, I didn't feel the desire to contribute to the same things anymore
outside of my day job and I stopped.

Luckily, not only did I become aware of my burnout but I realized that this burnout was seasonal, and now is the time
for that season to end.  I have a new desire to write, and not just about software-related topics.  So here I am, hoping
to kickstart a new approach to writing much more as an outlet than it is to gain notariety.

A few years back I bought the `thiswith.me` domain, with hopes of starting fresh and writing more from the perspective
of having a discussion about things.  Sure, I will continue to write blog posts _(more like articles)_ on software
development things.  But I would also like to share my opinions and thoughts on things that might be more difficult to
do on Twitter or the likes.

To kickstart this new goal, gone is `thoughtspark.org` _(it will redirect here)_ and now `discuss.thiswith.me` will be
used to host this site.  This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the theme being used is a
slightly-modified version of the [Anatole](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/anatole/) theme.  Like `thoughtspark.org`,
`discuss.thiswith.me` is hosted on [GitHub](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).

Here's to hoping that a fresh beginning ends up becoming a creative outlet for me, and hopefuly the stuff posted on this
site ends up being useful for anyone visiting.
