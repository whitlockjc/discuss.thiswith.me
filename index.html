<div class="article-content">
  <p>I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s time to rethink how I maintain and deploy <a href="http://www.thoughtspark.org">ThoughtSpark.org</a>.  My
current deployment model is to use <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> to craft/host my site&#39;s content and I currently
pay a small monthly fee to <a href="http://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a> for hosting Drupal.  While there isn&#39;t anything
really <strong>wrong</strong> with my current model, I&#39;ve grown tired of it.  Below are a few pain points worth mentioning.</p>

<h3>Maintenance Overhead</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve grown tired of maintaining Drupal.  I&#39;m tired of applying a security patch or verision update and having my
whole site turn to crap.  Why?  All of my modules then need to be re-enabled and/or updated.  How is this a
problem?  All non-core functionality on my site <em>(sitemap.xml generation, SPAM filtering, syntax highlighting, &hellip;)</em>
are all enabled via modules.  If these modules are disabled during the update, and they are, I now have to go through
the process of re-enabling them just so my site doesn&#39;t look like crap and I don&#39;t get SPAMed to Hell and back.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, Drupal is a phenomenal product.  It&#39;s an excellent
<abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> and Drupal is also a great example of what an
<abbr title="Open Source Software">OSS</abbr> project should be.  It&#39;s not Drupal&#39;s fault that I don&#39;t need a
<abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> and I&#39;m sure there is a reason that the update process is more
painful than I&#39;d like.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the maintenance overhead is the fact that Drupal runs on <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a> and needs a
database, <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> in my case, so you have to either host your server or pay someone to host it
you.  I chose the second option.  The overhead for this of course is the financial cost, regardless of how large or
small it is.</p>

<h3>Authoring</h3>

<p>The options I&#39;ve been exposed to in Drupal for authoring content on my site is to use raw
<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> or using one of the
<abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors.  The problem with raw HTML is it&#39;s cumbersom and
error prone.  Crafting a single post can often end up with a lot of time spent finding HTML typos.  The problem with
WYSIWYG editors is that you often end up fighting them.  Either the output is junk or they don&#39;t handle certain use
cases, like handling code blocks.  Regardless, I loathe creating content in Drupal but again, I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s
Drupal&#39;s fault, I just want something simpler.</p>

<p>One approach to creating web-based content I&#39;ve become very fond of as of late is
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.  Markdown is a great language that allows me to focus more
on the content being crafted while still being able to style my content very easily.  I can even drop in raw HTML
wheenver I feel the need to.  If you&#39;ve ever visited any <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a> project/user homepage or
a project&#39;s wiki, you&#39;ve seen the result of Markdown.</p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>The new ThoughtSpark.org will no longer be using Drupal and will no longer be deployed on GoDaddy.  Instead, I&#39;m going
to use a static website generator that will take my Markdown files and create my website.  The tool I will be using is
<a href="http://www.middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a> and I will be using <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> as my host.  Not
only will writing/maintaining my website content be easier but now it will also require no cost to host.  Those two
things are good enough reasons for me to switch but there are also the following reasons that are equally compelling:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: With there being no server-side component and no server-side processing, there are much fewer security
issues that I need to concern myself with</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: With there being no server-side component and no server-side processing, the performance of the site
will be faster</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>: The solutions for hosting static websites are plentiful and you are no longer locked into a
particular host/product for hosting your website.  <em>(There&#39;s a chance you&#39;re already using a
service that will host your static websites for you.  Examples: GitHub&#39;s Pages and 
<a href="http://www.dropboxwiki.com/Hosting_Websites_with_Dropbox">DropBox</a> are two excellent examples.)</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>In Closing</h3>

<p>GitHub Pages, Markdown, Middleman and <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> have made it very easy
for me to re-create and maintain ThoughtSpark.org.  I feel like with this new approach for ThoughtSpark.org, I&#39;ll be
able to get posts out quicker and much easier, while saving a few bucks along the way.  Thanks for your patience and I
look forward to sharing with you on my new platform.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There are a few things left to finish before I&#39;d say that the migration is complete, follow
<a href="https://github.com/whitlockjc/thoughtspark.org/issues/1">here</a> if you&#39;re interested.
<strong>Note:</strong> Originally I had planned on migrating all of the old Drupal posts to the new platform.  I&#39;ve decided against
it for a few reasons and will instead only migrate things upon request.  To request such a thing, use the

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>When building a <a href="http://subversion.apache.org">Subversion</a> server, people usually go for the setup that requires the
least amount of administrative overhead.  For many, especially in the enterprise where
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory">Active Directory</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenLDAP">OpenLDAP</a>
rule, this means hooking up <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a> to a directory server to authenticate users via
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP">LDAP</a>.  The reason for such a setup is that you can use the same credentials that
log you into your computer, and other internal resources usually, to access Subversion.  One less set of credentials
for the user to remember and one less user data store for the administrator to maintain.  Initially, this scenario is
without any real disadvantage.  But once you want to start using your groups defined in your directory with
<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz.html">Subversion&#39;s authorization</a> (authz)
mechanism, you find one of the shortcomings of such a configuration.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Subversion&#39;s authz architecture requires your group definitions to be defined within the authz file.  Subversion&#39;s
authz architecture is also unaware of third-party data stores for users/groups.  This means that if you do not define
your group within the authz file, Subversion will not know whether a user is a member of said group and will
ultimately tell you that you do not have access to a resource.  That being said, the current problem is that with
this server configuration, either you cannot harness group models defined in your directory server or you have to
manually synchronize your group models from your directory server to Subversion&#39;s authz file.  There are many
downsides to doing things this way:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s time consuming</li>
<li>It&#39;s easy to forget that changes have been made and need to be mirrored</li>
<li>It&#39;s very easy to make mistakes when doing it yourself</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>So while using LDAP for Subversion authentication is a dream, things are not so nice when it comes to reusing your
group models for authz that are defined in your directory server.</p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>Well, it just so happens that I have a solution.  One that is repeatable, loss-less and can be easily setup using the
same information you used to configure Apache to authenticate your Subversion users.  The solution is the
<strong>LDAP Groups to Subversion Authz Groups Bridge</strong> script. <strong>(Note: This script, its license and a duplicate of this
documentation are attached to the bottom of this article.)</strong></p>

<p>The &ldquo;LDAP Groups to Subversion Authz Groups Bridge&rdquo; script is written in Python and, as mentioned before, does its work
in a loss-less fashion.  This means that while this script will take on the trouble of taking your groups models
defined in your directory server and reproducing them in a Subversion authz file, the script will not prohibit you from
creating group definitions within the authz file that are not defined in your directory server.  Tired of all of the
background?  Ready to see the script in action?  Let&#39;s go.</p>

<h3>The Implementation</h3>

<p>Implementing the &ldquo;LDAP Groups to Subversion Authz Groups Bridge&rdquo; is actually simple.  If you&#39;ve already configured
Apache to authenticate your Subversion users, which we will not be covering, you can honestly copy/paste pieces of the
Apache configuration into the script.  Before we go through an example though, there are a few prerequisites that you
need to have taken care of before the script will run:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install Python (<a href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a>)</li>
<li>Install the python-ldap module (<a href="http://python-ldap.sourceforge.net">http://python-ldap.sourceforge.net</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we have those things out of the way, let&#39;s look at the help output of the script, just to get our bearings:</p>

<p>Anything that has a <strong>[Default:</strong> string in its corresponding documentation is &ldquo;optional&rdquo; and can usually be omitted
when running against most directory servers.  The things that are not optional are things that you can get from your
Apache configuration.  Now that we have our bearings, let&#39;s see an example.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s pretend that I have a directory structure like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Release Managers (CN=Release Managers,OU=Groups,DC=subversion,DC=thoughtspark,DC=org)

<ul>
<li>Release Manager One (CN=Release Manager One,OU=Users,DC=subversion,DC=thoughtspark,DC=org)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Developers (CN=Developers,OU=Groups,DC=subversion,DC=thoughtspark,DC=org)

<ul>
<li>Release Managers (CN=Release Managers,OU=Nested Groups,OU=Groups,DC=subversion,DC=thoughtspark,DC=org)</li>
<li>Developer One (CN=Developer One,OU=Users,DC=subversion,DC=thoughtspark,DC=org)</li>
<li>Developer Two (CN=Developer Two,OU=Users,DC=subversion,DC=thoughtspark,DC=org)</li>
<li>Developer Three (CN=Developer Three,OU=Users,DC=subversion,DC=thoughtspark,DC=org)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Release Managers (CN=Release Managers,OU=Nested Groups,OU=Groups,DC=subversion,DC=thoughtspark,DC=org)

<ul>
<li>Release Manager Two (CN=Release Manager Two,OU=Users,DC=subversion,DC=thoughtspark,DC=org)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Administrators (CN=Administrators,CN=Roles,DC=subversion,DC=thoughtspark,DC=org)

<ul>
<li>Jeremy Whitlock (CN=Jeremy Whitlock,OU=Users,DC=subversion,DC=thoughtspark,DC=org)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>(Yes&hellip;I have two groups with the same name but in different locations. This will help showcase how the <strong>LDAP Groups
to Subversion Authz Groups Bridge</strong> handles this situation.)  I now want to run the script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">sync_ldap_groups_to_svn_authz</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">py</span> <span class="o">\</span>
  <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">d</span> &quot;<span class="n">CN</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">Jeremy</span> <span class="n">Whitlock</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">OU</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">Users</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">subversion</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">thoughtspark</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">org</span>&quot; <span class="o">\</span>
  <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">l</span> &quot;<span class="n">ldap</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">localhost</span><span class="p">:</span>389&quot; <span class="o">\</span>
  <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">b</span> &quot;<span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">subversion</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">thoughtspark</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">org</span>&quot; <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">svn_auth</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">txt</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>You&#39;ll notice I didn&#39;t specify a password.  In this event, the script will prompt you, securely, for a password.  After
the script runs, as long as you didn&#39;t run with the &ldquo;-q&rdquo; flag, you should see output like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">Successfully</span> <span class="n">bound</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">ldap</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">localhost</span><span class="p">:</span>389
4 <span class="n">groups</span> <span class="n">found</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Okay, things ran smoothly.  (If you notice any <strong>[WARNING]</strong> output, just look at the message along side the warning to
see why.)  So what does the file look like?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">[groups]</span>

<span class="c">### Start generated content: LDAP Groups to Subversion Authz Groups Bridge (2009/01/19 23:17:07) ###</span>

</div>

<p>Here is a list of features, or things to realize, based on the output of this script:</p>

<ul>
<li>The &ldquo;[groups]&rdquo; section is created but only if necessary</li>
<li>All generated content is within known &ldquo;markers&rdquo; for loss-less regeneration</li>
<li>The header tells you when the file was last synchronized</li>
<li>Nested groups, of any level, are supported</li>
<li>Groups with the same name, but different locations, are supported</li>
<li>An easy-to-read legend is created for reference reasons</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve seen a very simple example, let&#39;s see one more example of how we might take an Apache configuration and
turn that into a call to the &ldquo;LDAP Groups to Subversion Authz Groups Bridge&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Below we have a snippet of the important parts of an Apache configuration using LDAP for Subversion authentication:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">...</span>
# <span class="n">The</span> <span class="n">distinguished</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">bind</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">directory</span> <span class="n">server</span>
<span class="n">AuthLDAPBindDN</span> &quot;<span class="n">CN</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">Jeremy</span> <span class="n">Whitlock</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">OU</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">Users</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">subversion</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">thoughtspark</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">org</span>&quot;

# <span class="n">The</span> <span class="n">password</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">user</span> <span class="n">above</span>
<span class="n">AuthLDAPBindPassword</span> &quot;<span class="n">myP455w0rd</span>&quot;

# <span class="n">The</span> <span class="n">LDAP</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="n">url</span>
<span class="n">AuthLDAPURL</span> &quot;<span class="n">ldap</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">localhost</span><span class="p">:</span>389<span class="o">/</span><span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">subversion</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">thoughtspark</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">org</span>?<span class="n">sAMAccountName</span>?<span class="n">sub</span>?<span class="p">(</span><span class="n">objectClass</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">)</span>&quot;
<span class="p">...</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>With the above information, Apache could connect to my theoretical Active Directory server and look for user objects.
The way Apache identifies user objects is by the &ldquo;objectClass&rdquo; attribute being set to &ldquo;user&rdquo;.  Once a user is found,
the <strong>sAMAccountName</strong> attribute is queried to see if it matches the user logging in.  Once the user is found, it is
authenticated.  That being said, let&#39;s parse this information and turn it into a successful call to the <strong>LDAP Groups
to Subversion Authz Groups Bridge</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">sync_ldap_groups_to_svn_authz</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">py</span> <span class="o">\</span>
  <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">d</span> &quot;<span class="n">CN</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">Jeremy</span> <span class="n">Whitlock</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">OU</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">Users</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">subversion</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">thoughtspark</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">org</span>&quot; <span class="o">\</span>
  <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">p</span> &quot;<span class="n">myP455w0rd</span>&quot; <span class="o">\</span>
  <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">l</span> &quot;<span class="n">ldap</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">localhost</span><span class="p">:</span>389&quot; <span class="o">\</span>
  <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">b</span> &quot;<span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">subversion</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">thoughtspark</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">DC</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">org</span>&quot; <span class="o">\</span>
  <span class="o">-</span><span class="nb">i</span> &quot;<span class="n">sAMAccountName</span>&quot; <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">svn_auth</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">txt</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>The new things you see in this call that differ from the first call is that we are now looking for the
<strong>sAMAccountName</strong> attribute for the username instead of the &ldquo;cn&rdquo; attribute.  You also see that we can pass the
password as a command line argument.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>So now that we&#39;ve seen how the script is ran, what is necessary to get it running and even a complete example, it&#39;s
now up to you to get this thing into your Subversion infrastructure.  Immediate ideas are to automate this with your
operating system&#39;s task scheduler and/or create a web interface to kick this script off on an as-needed basis.
Regardless of how you use it, the &ldquo;LDAP Groups to Subversion Authz Groups Bridge&rdquo; should make the error-prone, tedious
and easy-to-forget process of manually synchronizing your LDAP group models to Subversion&#39;s authz file much, much
easier.  It might even get so easy you forget that Subversion doesn&#39;t natively support LDAP groups.</p>

<h3>Change History</h3>

<ul>
<li>2009-01-22 - There was a bug when you didn&#39;t specify the -z flag and when the query returned no groups.  Version 1.0.1 has been produced as a result.</li>
<li>2009-04-15 - There was a bug introduced when reformatting the code that broke the nested groups support.  Version 1.0.2 has been produced as a result.</li>
</ul>
